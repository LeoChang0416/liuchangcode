  "podcastContent": "金刚经呢是佛祖跟须菩提的对话，全文呢仅仅5000字，但是这5000字却代表了人类智慧的巅峰。\n读懂后会让人豁然开朗，从此开悟，六组禅师是不识字的，但是在他年轻的时候，也是偶尔听到了金刚经的一句话就开悟了，可见这本书的神力。\n首先金刚经的开始呢，是以这样一种的对话，佛祖问须菩提，恒河里的沙子多不多，须菩提说当然多，佛祖又问如果有人散尽家财像恒河里的沙子这样多的财富，去做慈善，算不算一种功德呢，须菩提说当然算，佛祖又说有一种功德\n比这个更大，那就是在你开悟之后把金刚经最核心的四句话解释给众人听，让更多人开悟，这才是莫大的功德。\n第一句，若菩萨有我相、人相、众生相、寿者相、皆非菩萨相，佛祖说如果你看到的菩萨，他长得像我这样的人或者你这样的或者像路人这样的或者像一个长寿的，那他都不是菩萨，也就是说如果我们拜的那个菩萨拥有像人一样的相都不是菩萨，菩萨根本就没有人相，也就是没有相\n第二句，凡以色拜我，以音声求我，人行邪道，不能见如来。意思就是说凡是看见我就拜的人，或者听到我的声音就求我的人，都是执迷于佛祖的表象，这都是邪道，永远都不可能见到如来。\n第三句，凡有所相，皆是虚妄，若见诸相非相即见如来，",

  "prompt": "[CANVAS]\n- Format: 1:1 square, 1024x1024 pixels\n- Safe margin: 10% padding on all sides\n- Whitespace target: 70% minimum, achieved through expansive, uniform neutral background.\n- Visual weight distribution: Visual weight is concentrated in the lower central portion of the image, carried by three fading fragments. The weight dissipates upwards and outwards into vast emptiness, creating a grounded yet expansive feeling of stillness.\n\n[TOPOLOGY] — Based on topologicalLayout\n- Zone count: 1 (Single unified field)\n- Division method: none (No partitions or hard boundaries)\n- Zone ratios: 100 (The entire canvas is one continuous space)\n- Physical metaphor visualization: The single zone represents the undivided, transparent essence of water (or emptiness) within which the phenomenon of the ‘moon reflection’ appears and fragments. The lack of division emphasizes non-duality and fusion.\n\n[RELATIONSHIPS] — Based on primaryRelationship\n- Primary relationship type: fragmenting (One primary form breaking apart)\n- Interaction quality: fused (The fragments are seamlessly merging with their surrounding medium)\n- Spatial expression: Three circular fragments, derived from a single implied whole, are arranged in a loose vertical stack in the lower central area. They are not centrally anchored but appear as a moment captured in a downward-dissipating trajectory. The largest and most defined fragment is at the top, followed by progressively smaller, more transparent, and more incomplete fragments below, illustrating the process of dissolution.\n\n[RHYTHM] — Based on rhythmSignature\n- Rhythm type: echoing (A repeating but fading pattern)\n- Element count: 3 (The three fragments)\n- Interval/size variation: The fragments decrease in size and opacity from top to bottom. The intervals between their implied centers are subtly uneven, leaning towards a decelerating spread as they fade, mimicking the final, lingering echoes of a ripple before stillness returns.\n\n[GEOMETRY]\n- Primary shape: Three arced fragments of circles. The top fragment is roughly 70% of a full circle, the middle about 50%, and the bottom a faint 30%. All are positioned with their broken edges facing vaguely downward/outward.\n- Secondary shapes: None.\n- Lines: None.\n- Edge treatment: Extremely soft, blurred, and feathered edges. No hard lines. The fragments appear to be made of mist or light dissolving into the background, adhering to the Samādhi degree's soft edge preference.\n- Negative space: Ample, calm, and uniform negative space occupies the entire canvas, enveloping the fragments. It is active in its emptiness, providing the ‘field’ in which the phenomenon occurs and vanishes.\n\n[COLOR]\n- Background: A very light, cool mist-white (#F3F5F6), evoking paper or still water surface.\n- Primary hue: A tranquil, very light cerulean or water blue. Gradient from a slightly more saturated #B8E2F0 at the core of the top fragment to near-transparency #E8F4F8 at the edges and in the lower fragments.\n- Secondary hue: None.\n- Temperature: Cool and serene, with a slight ethereal blue cast, reflecting the Samādhi degree's preference for清凉宁静 (cool and tranquil) temperatures.\n- Contrast method: Brightness and transparency contrast only. The fragments are discernible through subtle variations in value and opacity against the slightly darker/brighter background, not through hue contrast.\n\n[LIGHTING]\n- Light source: Ambient, diffuse, and omnidirectional. No discernible directional light.\n- Glow effects: 1. A very subtle, inner glow within the top and middle fragments, suggesting they are made of luminous mist. The glow color is the same light blue, at very low opacity.\n- Ambient atmosphere: Even, soft, and hazy illumination. The overall light feels still and meditative, as if under a full moon through thin cloud cover.\n\n[TEXTURE & MATERIAL] — Samādhi degree微调\n- Surface quality: Smooth, with a slight satin or watery sheen on the background. The fragments have no texture, appearing as pure, smooth light or vapor.\n- Edge sharpness: Extremely low. Edges are gradients into the background.\n- Transparency: High and varied transparency is key. The fragments use multiple layers of transparency to achieve the fading, echoing effect.\n\n[ATMOSPHERE & MOOD]\n- Japanese aesthetic: Strong Ma (間 – negative space, interval, pause). Kanso (簡素 – simplicity) in form and color. Shibui (渋い – subtle, quiet beauty) in the understated elegance of the fading blue.\n- Content resonance: A visual haiku of impermanence and clarity. The tension between the recognizable ‘moon’ form and its inevitable fragmentation visualizes the move from attachment to form (‘执相’) to seeing its empty nature (‘破相’). The resulting mood is one of profound calm and lucid awakening.\n\n[STYLE]\n- Render style: Clean, vector-like digital art with soft gradients and transparency.\n- Absolutely no photorealism, no 3D rendering, no detailed textures.\n- High clarity and legibility even when scaled down to a 128px thumbnail, relying on clear value differences and simple shapes.",
