  "prompt": "[CANVAS]\n- Format: 1:1 square, 1024x1024 pixels\n- Safe margin: 10% padding on all sides.\n- Whitespace target: 75%. The vast majority of the frame is filled with the serene, warm cream background, with visual elements concentrated gently towards the center.\n- Visual weight distribution: A subtle, soft focus at the very center of the canvas, where a small, dense form rests. From it, visual weight diffuses outward through faint, translucent layers that dissolve into the background, creating a deep, receding sense of calm.\n\n[TOPOLOGY]\n- Zone count: 1. A single, unified field of empty space (Ma) representing the tranquil mind-lake and emptiness.\n- Division method: None. No hard divisions, only soft transitions of transparency and tone.\n- Zone ratios: 100% undivided space.\n- Physical metaphor visualization: The entire canvas is the \"lake surface.\" The central element and its emanating layers are the momentary \"ripple\" event within this vast stillness. The deepest, most translucent outer layer of the ripple visually sinks back into the lake, enhancing its perceived depth and tranquility after the disturbance passes.\n\n[RELATIONSHIPS]\n- Primary relationship type: Solo. A single, condensed primary form exists independently.\n- Interaction quality: Distant. The form is centered but does not dominate; it is a small event within a vast field.\n- Spatial expression: The solo form sits at the optical center. The echoing ripple layers are not perfectly concentric but slightly offset, suggesting a natural, organic propagation and dissipation rather than a mechanical pattern. Their primary relationship is with the surrounding space into which they fade.\n\n[RHYTHM]\n- Rhythm type: Echoing. Three distinct but related layers repeat the elliptical form.\n- Element count: 3 (the ripple layers).\n- Interval/size variation: Each successive layer is significantly larger than the last. The key variation is in opacity and edge definition: Layer 1 (innermost) has the highest opacity and softest internal focus. Layer 2 is larger, more transparent, with edges beginning to disperse. Layer 3 (outermost) is the largest, the most transparent, and its outer edge is treated with a slightly deeper tint of the primary hue that gently gradients into the background, creating the \"deepening calm\" effect.\n\n[GEOMETRY]\n- Primary shape: A small, soft, irregularly rounded聚合体 (aggregate form) at the center. Dimensions: approx 3% of canvas width. No sharp corners; edges are profoundly blurred and feathered.\n- Secondary shapes: Three large, overlapping, semi-transparent elliptical shapes emanating from just outside the primary shape. They are not perfect circles but soft ovals. Their edges are completely diffused, with no visible lines.\n- Lines: None used.\n- Edge treatment: Extremely soft, feathered, vapor-like edges for all elements. No hard transitions.\n- Negative space: The cream-colored background is the dominant negative space, enveloping all elements. The ripple layers themselves become negative space (transparency) through which the background is visible.\n\n[COLOR]\n- Background: Solid cream (#FFFEF5).\n- Primary hue: Mint-mist green (#E8F5E9). Used at varying opacities and a single deeper value for the outermost ripple edge.\n- Secondary hue: Blush red (#FFEBEE). Used minimally as a tiny, soft core within the central primary shape (covering less than 9% of its area, at approx 22% opacity), providing a subtle warm accent.\n- Temperature: Warm-neutral. The cream background and mint-mist green create a gentle, welcoming, and serene warmth.\n- Contrast method: Brightness. Structure is defined almost exclusively through subtle variations in value (lightness/darkness) of the mint-mist hue against the cream background, and through opacity.\n- Accent usage: The blush red is a faint, almost imperceptible glow at the very heart of the central form. It is a noticeable but deeply subordinate accent, adding a point of gentle warmth and life.\n\n[LIGHTING]\n- Light source: Ambient, omnidirectional, and diffused.\n- Glow effects: 1. A very subtle, wide glow emanates from the central primary shape, blending with the first ripple layer. It is the mint-mist color at very low opacity.\n- Ambient atmosphere: Even, soft, and misty. As if viewing the scene through a thin veil of calm air.\n\n[TEXTURE & MATERIAL]\n- Surface quality: Smooth, matte, and slightly ethereal. Like thin silk or water surface film.\n- Edge sharpness: All edges are infinitely soft and gradient. No sharpness.\n- Transparency: Critical. The three ripple layers have high and increasing transparency: ~40%, ~20%, ~8%. The outermost layer's edge deepens in color value before fading to full transparency, creating the illusion of depth and \"return to profound calm.\"\n\n[ATMOSPHERE & MOOD]\n- Japanese aesthetic: Ma ( profound negative space), Kanso (simplicity), Shibui (subtle, quiet beauty).\n- Content resonance: A visual meditation on the release of attachment (the ripple dissipates) and the deep, accepting peace that remains (the tranquil, deepened lake). Evokes释然 (relief) and安宁 (tranquility).\n\n[STYLE]\n- Render style: Clean, vector-like digital art with extreme softness and gradient control.\n- No photorealism, no 3D rendering.\n- Must maintain high clarity and compositional balance even when viewed as a 128px thumbnail.",
