  "prompt": "[CANVAS]\n- Format: 1:1 square, 1024x1024 pixels.\n- Safe margin: 10% padding on all sides.\n- Whitespace target: 75% or more, achieved through the expansive, uniformly deep-toned background that envelops the central focal point.\n- Visual weight distribution: Extreme central focus. Nearly all visual weight is concentrated on the singular, glowing circular ‘eye’ at the absolute center of the canvas. The vast surrounding space holds minimal weight, serving purely as atmospheric depth.\n\n[TOPOLOGY]\n- Zone count: 1. The entire composition exists within a single, undivided field.\n- Division method: none. No lines, bands, or gaps segment the canvas.\n- Zone ratios: 100% singular zone.\n- Physical metaphor visualization: The single zone represents the ‘darkness’ or the field of consciousness within which the ‘eye’ opens. The central circular form is the ‘eye,’ and within its core, the tiny geometric shapes constitute the ‘clear world’ reflected in the pupil.\n\n[RELATIONSHIPS]\n- Primary relationship type: solo. There is one dominant entity: the eye.\n- Interaction quality: touching. The eye interacts with the surrounding space through its soft glow and the clarity it projects from within.\n- Spatial expression: The eye is centered both vertically and horizontally. Its relationship with the canvas is one of profound centering and focus, creating a powerful anchor point amidst vast emptiness.\n\n[RHYTHM]\n- Rhythm type: none. The composition is static and still, embodying a moment of perfect, stable clarity after awakening.\n- Element count: 1 primary element (the eye), with sub-elements (door, mountain) contained within it.\n- Interval/size variation: Not applicable due to static rhythm.\n\n[GEOMETRY]\n- Primary shape: A near-perfect circle, occupying approximately 15% of the canvas height, positioned at the exact center. Its edges are supremely soft, feathered, and blend gently into the background via a subtle glow.\n- Secondary shapes: Within the center of this circle, a much smaller, brighter circular area (the pupil) is defined. At the very heart of this pupil, two minimal geometric forms are implied with extreme subtlety: a slim, vertical rectangle (door) and a small, adjacent isosceles triangle (mountain peak). These are not drawn with hard lines but suggested through slight variations in luminosity and crispness.\n- Lines: No independent lines are used.\n- Edge treatment: All edges are exceptionally soft and blended. The transition from the eye’s glow to the background is gradual and atmospheric. The interior shapes within the pupil have slightly crisper definitions but remain integrated without hard borders.\n- Negative space: The negative space is the expansive background, which is not empty but filled with a uniform, warm, deep gray tone that provides immense depth and silence.\n\n[COLOR]\n- Background: A warm, deep gray. HEX range: #2A2A2A to #333333. It is dark but not black, carrying a subtle warmth (Virya bias).\n- Primary hue: A muted, papery warm white. HEX range: #F7F2E8 for the main eye body, transitioning to a purer, brighter white (#FFFFFF) at the very center (pupil).\n- Secondary hue: Not applicable beyond the primary hue variation.\n- Temperature: Warm. The entire palette leans towards warm neutrals, avoiding cold tones, in alignment with Virya's energetic yet clear bias.\n- Contrast method: Brightness contrast. The primary contrast is between the luminous, warm whites of the central forms and the deep, warm gray of the background. This creates a clear, eye-catching focus without relying on hue contrast.\n\n[LIGHTING]\n- Light source: Internal/emissive. The central ‘eye’ and ‘pupil’ appear to generate their own soft, clear light.\n- Glow effects: One primary glow effect. A very subtle, wide glow emanates from the edges of the main circular eye, gently illuminating the immediate surrounding background and creating a sense of atmospheric perspective.\n- Ambient atmosphere: The overall lighting is soft, diffuse, and focused. There are no harsh shadows. The atmosphere is one of quiet luminescence emerging from within darkness.\n\n[TEXTURE & MATERIAL]\n- Surface quality: Smooth and refined. The eye surface has a soft, matte ceramic or fine paper quality. The background is perfectly smooth and uniform.\n- Edge sharpness: Extremely soft and blended edges overall, with a slight increase in definition only at the core pupil elements to suggest ‘clarity.’\n- Transparency: The glow from the central circle has a very low opacity, allowing the background tone to show through, enhancing depth.\n\n[ATMOSPHERE & MOOD]\n- Japanese aesthetic: Ma (間) – The profound sense of space and interval between the focal point and the boundless background is paramount. Kanso (簡素) – Extreme simplicity and elimination of clutter. Shibui (渋い) – Subtle, refined beauty in the restrained use of light and form.\n- Content resonance: Awe and clarity. The vast space inspires awe, while the precise, luminous center evokes the relief and clarity of sudden understanding (‘seeing the door and the room within’).\n\n[STYLE]\n- Render style: Clean, vector-like digital art with ultra-soft gradients and blends.\n- No photorealism, no 3D rendering. The image should feel abstract, graphic, and contemplative.\n- High clarity at 128px thumbnail: The central luminous point must remain clearly visible even at very small sizes.",
